# HIHI
Arduino-based temperature control system, which emulates natural sinusoidal fluctuations.

This repository contains the operational code, R script, and all original data for the Practical Tools paper "In the heat of the moment: including realistic thermal fluctuations using an open-source thermoregulator results in dramatically altered key population parameters". The paper investigates the impact of temperature fluctuations on ectotherm development, survival, and sex-ratio using an innovative and inexpensive Arduino-based temperature control system.
